## Background

I have a strong interest and great enthusiasm for methodological research to improve efficiency of clinical trials.

From 2015 to 2018, I have been appointed as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie research fellow in the IDEAS network and meanwhile working on my PhD at Lancaster University.
My PhD research was about Bayesian adaptive methods to incorporate preclinical data into phase I clinical trials, supervised by Dr Lisa Hampson and Professor Thomas Jaki.

I joined Newcastle University in October 2018, and am now working with Professor James Wason on Bayesian adaptive methods for basket trials.

## Research

Topics falling under the general remit of medical statistics are interesting to me.
To be more specific, I found

1. Bayesian adaptive designs,
2. early phase dose-finding trials, and
3. data augmentation techniques for trials with a small sample size

are particularly fascinating. 

I am open to new collaborations with both academia and pharmaceutical industry -- very much look forward to solving more problems relating to (but not limited to) the topics listed above.

## Teaching

I have been invited to deliver several tutorials on

1. Statistical Methods for Design and Analysis of Precision Medicine Trials, 24th & 25th March 2020
  - A short-course for postgraduates, statisticians and professionals who run clinical trials
  - Course information: [click here](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/training/short-courses/statistical-methods-for-design-and-analysis-of-precision-medicine-trials/)

2. Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials in the Era of Precision Medicine, 6th October 2019
  - A pre-conference educational workshop at [ICTMC 2019](https://ictmc2019.com/programme/)
3. Bayesian Statistics with Applications in Clinical Trials, 5th & 6th September 2019
  - A short-course for postgraduates and professionals who work in clinical research
  - Host: Department of Medical Statistics, Osaka City University (Japan)
