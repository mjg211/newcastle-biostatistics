## Background

I have a strong interest and great enthusiasm for methodological research to improve the efficiency of clinical trials.

From 2015 to 2018, I was appointed as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie research fellow in the [IDEAS network](http://www.ideas-itn.eu/) and meanwhile working on my PhD at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/).
My PhD research was about Bayesian adaptive methods to incorporate preclinical data into phase I clinical trials, supervised by [Dr Lisa Hampson](http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/lisa-hampson) and [Prof Thomas Jaki](http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/thomas-jaki).

I joined [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) in October 2018, and am now working with [Prof James Wason](/people/james_wason/) on Bayesian adaptive methods for basket trials.

## Research

Topics falling under the general remit of medical statistics are interesting to me.
To be more specific, I find:

1. Bayesian adaptive designs,
2. early phase dose-finding trials, and
3. data augmentation techniques for trials with a small sample size

particularly fascinating. 

I am open to new collaborations with both academia and pharmaceutical industry -- I am very much look forward to solving more problems relating to (but not limited to) the topics listed above.

## Teaching

I have been invited to deliver several tutorials:

1. Statistical Methods for Design and Analysis of Precision Medicine Trials, 24-25th March 2020
  - A short-course for postgraduates, statisticians and professionals who run clinical trials
  - Course information: [click here](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/training/short-courses/statistical-methods-for-design-and-analysis-of-precision-medicine-trials/).
  - Host: [MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/).
2. Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials in the Era of Precision Medicine, 6th October 2019
  - A pre-conference educational workshop at [ICTMC 2019](https://ictmc2019.com/programme/)
3. Bayesian Statistics with Applications in Clinical Trials, 5-6th September 2019
  - A short-course for postgraduates and professionals who work in clinical research.
  - Host: [Department of Medical Statistics](https://www.med.osaka-cu.ac.jp/departments/e-iryou-statistics.shtml), [Osaka City University](https://www.osaka-cu.ac.jp/en, Japan.
