## Background

I came to Newcastle University in 1987, following undergraduate and postgraduate studies in mathematics and statistics at Cambridge, a PhD at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine with Professor Michael Healy and a post-doctoral appointment at Oxford with Professor Peter Armitage.

I was awarded the Guy Medal in Bronze of the Royal Statistical Society in 1996 and served as President of the British and Irish Region of the International Biometric Society from 2014-2016.
