PPIPF was a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised pilot trial of omeprazole in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
A common symptom of IPF is a chronic cough which may be caused by acid reflux (acid leaking up from the stomach into the oesophagus).
Stomach acid can be switched off by drugs called proton pump inhibitors, one of which is omeprazole. 
If reflux of stomach acid does contribute to cough in IPF, omeprazole might be expected to reduce cough.
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive omeprazole or matching placebo twice daily for 90 days.
Cough frequency was assessed via a 24-hour cough monitor at baseline and at the end of treatment.

This pilot trial was designed to assess the feasibility of a larger, definitive multicentre trial of omeprazole in IPF.

The results of the study suggested larger trials are feasible but would require screening of large numbers of patients and careful monitoring of adverse events.
