Psoriasis Stratification to Optimise Relevant Therapy (PSORT) is a stratified medicine consortium formed by world leading dermatologists, industry partners including pharmaceutical companies and psoriasis patients.
Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition which affects more than 1.8 million people in the UK and can have a major impact of quality of life.
The overall research strategy is to identify stratifiers of response to biologic therapies for patients with psoriasis.
