TRAFIC is two part multi-centre phase Ib/ IIa trial investigating the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of seliciclib as an addition to existing therapy in participants with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

Part one of the trial aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of seliciclib in participants with active RA despite treatment with anti-TNF as either monotherapy or with background conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 

Part two will assess the response to treatment of the MTD.

*TRAFIC is funded by a grant from the Medical Research Council Developmental Pathway Funding Scheme (DPFS).*
