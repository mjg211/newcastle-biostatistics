UK-PBC is a unique collaboration between patient groups, doctors, scientists and industry with a shared interest in increasing understanding about, and treatment for the autoimmune liver disease Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC).

PBC affects up to 20,000 people in the UK and whereas many do well with current therapy an important group of people have more aggressive liver disease that can lead to liver failure and the need for a liver transplant or other significant long-term complications.

PBC patients also experience important symptoms such as fatigue, itch and concentration problems that can significantly impair quality of life.

The goal of UK-PBC is to understand why some patients with PBC do not respond to current treatments, to help identify better treatments, to demonstrate that those treatments help patients with PBC and ultimately improve clinical care across the UK for people with PBC.

*UK-PBC is funded by a grant from the Medical Research Council.*
