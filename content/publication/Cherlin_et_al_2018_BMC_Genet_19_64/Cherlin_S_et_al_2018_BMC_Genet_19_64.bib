 abstract = {Fenofibrate (Fb) is a known treatment for elevated triglyceride (TG) levels. The Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study was designed to investigate potential contributors to the effects of Fb on TG levels. Here, we summarize the analyses of 8 papers whose authors had access to the GOLDN data and were grouped together because they pursued investigations into Fb treatment responses as part of GAW20. These papers report explorations of a variety of genetics, epigenetics, and study design questions. Data regarding treatment with 160 mg of micronized Fb per day for 3 weeks included pretreatment and posttreatment TG and methylation levels (ML) at approximately 450,000 epigenetic markers (cytosine-phosphate-guanine [CpG] sites). In addition, approximately 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped or imputed in each of the study participants, drawn from 188 pedigrees.},
