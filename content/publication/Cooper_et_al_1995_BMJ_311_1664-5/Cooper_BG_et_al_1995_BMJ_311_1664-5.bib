 abstract = {Objective:To investigate the effect of watching different types of video on energy expenditure Design:Randomised study assessing a \$\backslash$textquotedblleft\pleasant,\$\backslash$textquotedblright\ an \$\backslash$textquotedblleft\amusing,\$\backslash$textquotedblright\ an \$\backslash$textquotedblleft\exciting,\$\backslash$textquotedblright\ and no video film clips. Subjects:12 volunteers who did not know the purpose of the study Main outcome measures:Changes in energy expenditure, substrate use, heart rate, and aural temperature during each film clip. Results: Energy expenditure was raised slightly (0.21 kJ/day) during the \$\backslash$textquotedblleft\exciting\$\backslash$textquotedblright\ film. Individual responses varied greatly. Conclusion:Watching different types of video seems to have little effect on resting metabolic rate.},
