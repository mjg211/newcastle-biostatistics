abstract = """Objective: To investigate the effect of watching different types of video on energy expenditure.

Design: Randomised study assessing a "pleasant," an "amusing," an "exciting," and no video film clips.

Subjects: 12 volunteers who did not know the purpose of the study.

Main outcome measures: Changes in energy expenditure, substrate use, heart rate, and aural temperature during each film clip.

Results: Energy expenditure was raised slightly (0.21 kJ/day) during the "exciting" film. Individual responses varied greatly.

Conclusion: Watching different types of video seems to have little effect on resting metabolic rate."""
