 abstract = {Background In more than 20% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, the patient\$\backslash$textquoteright\s airway is soiled. 1 2 If the airway cannot be cleared, the patient will die. A new method of clearing the airway, suction assisted laryngoscopy and airway decontamination (SALAD) has been developed, but it\$\backslash$textquoteright\s not known whether this method can assist paramedics to intubate.3 This study aims to determine whether paramedics can intubate a simulated soiled airway more often on their first attempt, using SALAD.Method A modified airway manikin, with the oesophagus connected to a reservoir of \$\backslash$textquoteleft\vomit\$\backslash$textquoteright\ and bilge pump, was used to simulate a soiled airway. The intervention was a brief SALAD training session with a demonstration and opportunity to practice. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups: AAB who made two pre-training intubation attempts and one post-training attempt, and ABB, who made one pre-training and two post-training attempts, to adjust for improvement due to repetition.Results 164 paramedics took part in the study. First-pass intubation success with and without SALAD was 90.2% and 53.7% respectively, a significant difference of 36.6% (95%CI 24$\backslash$%\$\backslash$textendash\49.1%, p\textless0.001). The mean successful intubation time for each attempt and patient group (AAB and ABB) was as follows: 61.8 (95%CI 55.8\$\backslash$textendash\67.8) and 59.4 (95%CI 53.6\$\backslash$textendash\65.1) s on the first attempt, 50.8 (95%CI 45.7\$\backslash$textendash\55.9) and 51.5 (95%CI 48.6\$\backslash$textendash\54.4) s on the second attempt and 53.5 (95%CI 50.4\$\backslash$textendash\56.6) and 46.6 (95%CI 44.0\$\backslash$textendash\49.1) s on the third attempt.Conclusion In this study, paramedics were able to intubate a simulated soiled airway on their first attempt, significantly more often when using the SALAD technique.ReferenceVoss S, Rhys M, Coates D, Greenwood R, Nolan JP, Thomas M, et al.
