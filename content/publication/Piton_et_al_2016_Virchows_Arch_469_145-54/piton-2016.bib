 abstract = {When misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cell is said to experience ER stress. This triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore the balance between misfolded proteins and ER chaperones such as BiP. UPR signalling is required for the growth of many solid cancers. In chronic ER stress, factors including CHOP have been shown to mediate cell death. Colorectal adenocarcinoma arises due to progressive changes within pre-malignant lesions. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that the expression of BiP and CHOP correlates with the progression of those pre-malignant lesions.},
