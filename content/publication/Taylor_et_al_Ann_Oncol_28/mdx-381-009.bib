 abstract = {Background: Population stratification with molecular biomarkers could improve the cost-benefit of lung cancer screening programmes and reduce false positives. We aim to establish that somatic copy number aberrations (SCNA) are detected in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of lung cancer cases. We hypothesise that the number and magnitude of SCNA might also serve as a discriminative test to aid early lung cancer detection.Methods: Standard protocols were followed to process matched cfDNA and lymphocyte DNA for 51 untreated lung cancer cases, 30 high risk controls and 10 low risk controls. Low coverage DNA sequencing was carried out on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and read copy number profiles were established with the software CNAnorm. A genomic instability score was evaluated by defining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).},
