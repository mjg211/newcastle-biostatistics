 abstract = {A method is described to investigate the inheritance of disease predisposition in cancer families. It is an extension of classic genetic linkage analysis, which enables information on loss of constitutional heterozygosity (LOCH) to be incorporated into the model. This adapted model treats LOCH data as additional observations on the disease phenotype. One of the major benefits of this approach is that isolated parent-offspring pairs are now potentially informative for linkage analysis. Examples are presented.},
